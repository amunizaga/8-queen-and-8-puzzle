# Each piece is identified by the letter P followed by an integer (1-9)
# then follows a semi-colon.  A single integer after the semi-colon corresponds
# to the location according to the above board layout diagram.
P1:1
P2:2
P3:3
P4:4
P5:5
P6:6
P7:7
P8:9


# If the puzzle above is completed optimally, it will take OMC (optimal move count) moves.
# OMC followed by a semi-colon and a single integer will communicate that value to 
# the program
OMC:7


# there is only 1 valid solution to the 8 puzzle problem.  GS (Goal State) defines
# the order for the pieces, starting at 1 and counting to 9. a 0 indicates that space
# should be blank in the goal state.
GS:P4,P5,P6,0,P1,P2,P8,P7,P3
